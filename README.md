# CraftingWPF

This was the second major project in my C# programming 2 class. The assignment was to build a GUI application using WPF where you can craft items according to a recipe, and buy/sell items to a shop for a profit. Much of the crafting logic I wrote over the course of some in-class assignments earlier in the semester, so this project was mostly fleshing out the system and creating a graphic interface for it.

I think it came out pretty nicely. All the functionality I wanted is there. It's crazy how much better a simple WPF app can look when you use a pretty color palette.
I have considered making a whole game in WPF similar to this, with simple graphics and still a mostly text based interface. So maybe there will be more projects like this in the future.
